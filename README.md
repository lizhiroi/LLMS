### Project Description:

The Landlord Management System (LLMS) is a comprehensive desktop application designed to streamline and automate the management of rental properties for landlords. The core objective of LLMS is to provide an intuitive and user-friendly platform for landlords to manage their properties, leases, tenants, and related financial transactions efficiently. LLMS aims to reduce administrative overhead, improve accuracy in record-keeping, and enhance tenant satisfaction.

The system features a modular design, comprising four main components: property management, lease management, tenant management, and property list.
